One poem, one sentence, seventeen syllables--often by surprise.

Tompkins Square Lower East Side N.Y.
Four skin heads stand in the streetlight rain chatting under an umbrella.

WARNING:

May contain spoilers for these literary classics.
Also note that the ones from "My Secret Life" tend to be very, very dirty.

TODO - dictionary is inadequate and doesn't recognize common stemmed words (e.g. bar but not bars, drop but not dropped)
Original source was http://hindson.com.au/info/free/free-english-language-hyphenation-dictionary/
Switch to use CMU version cmudict-0.7b but note that some words have alternate pronunciations with more or fewer syllables, only the first given is taken currently

Also note that as with anything the dictionary is good but far from complete so words are missing
